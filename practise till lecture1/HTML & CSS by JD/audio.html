    Lyrics
<marquee direction="up">You're the light, you're the night<br>
You're the color of my blood<br>
You're the cure, you're the pain<br>
You're the only thing I wanna touch<br>
Never knew that it could mean so much, so much<br>
You're the fear, I don't care<br>
'Cause I've never been so high<br>
Follow me through the dark<br>
Let me take you past our satellites<br>
You can see the world you brought to life, to life<br>
So love me like you do, lo-lo-love me like you do<br>
Love me like you do, lo-lo-love me like you do<br>
Touch me like you do, to-to-touch me like you do<br>
What are you waiting for?<br>
Fading in, fading out<br>
On the edge of paradise<br>
Every inch of your skin is a holy grail I've gotta find<br>
Only you can set my heart on fire, on fire<br>
Yeah, I'll let you set the pace<br>
'Cause I'm not thinking straight<br>
My head spinning around, I can't see clear no more<br>
What are you waiting for?<br>
Love me like you do, lo-lo-love me like you do<br>
Love me like you do, lo-lo-love me like you do<br>
Touch me like you do, to-to-touch me like you do<br>
What are you waiting for?<br>
Love me like you do, lo-lo-love me like you do (like you do)<br>
Love me like you do, lo-lo-love me like you do (yeah)<br>
Touch me like you do, to-to-touch me like you do<br>
What are you waiting for?<br>
I'll let you set the pace<br>
'Cause I'm not thinking straight<br>
My head spinning around, I can't see clear no more<br>
What are you waiting for?<br>
Love me like you do, lo-lo-love me like you do (like you do)<br>
Love me like you do, lo-lo-love me like you do (yeah)<br>
Touch me like you do, to-to-touch me like you do<br>
What are you waiting for?<br>
Love me like you do, lo-lo-love me like you do (like you do)<br>
Love me like you do, lo-lo-love me like you do (yeah)<br>
Touch me like you do, to-to-touch me like you do<br>
What are you waiting for?<br>
